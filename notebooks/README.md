## 06. Working on a cluster

 - Synchronize deployments between the local machine and a notebook running on the cluster.
 - Perform simple computations using the Dask deployment on a deployed notebook.
 - Clear synchronized deployments.

## 07. Adjusting timeouts

 - Adjust deployment timeouts, if your deployments fail too often.

## 08. Using the quick deployment app

 - Use the idact-notebook app to quickly deploy a notebook to work with.

## 09. Demo analysis

 - Download a large quantity of CSV data for analysis.
 - Load the data using Dask on the cluster.
 - Convert the data to a more suitable format: Apache Parquet.
 - Load the data from Parquet.
